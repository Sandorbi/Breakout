# Breakout

Arcade game Breakout was invented by
Steve Wozniak before he founded Apple with Steve Jobs.
The colored rectangles in the top part of the screen are bricks, and the slightly larger rectangle at the bottom is the paddle. The
paddle is in a fixed position in the vertical dimension, but moves back and forth across the screen along
with the mouse until it reaches the edge of its space.
A complete game consists of three turns. On each turn, a ball is launched from the center of the
window toward the bottom of the screen at a random angle. That ball bounces off the paddle and the
walls of the world, in accordance with the physical principle generally expressed as “the angle of
incidence equals the angle of reflection” 
When the ball collides with bricks, the ball bounces just as it does on any other collision, but the brick
disappears.
